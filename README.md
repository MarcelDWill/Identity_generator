Eagle 2230: Character Generator

Interactive character ticket generator built to enhance the storytelling experience of the upcoming novel Eagle 2230.
Blending responsive UI, randomized logic, and thematic design, this app invites readers to step into the emotional world of the story — one ticket at a time.

🚂 1. The Visual Presentation

Hero Demo GIF
To showcase responsiveness, the project includes a screen recording of the generator in action. As the user clicks, a “ticket” dynamically updates in real-time — demonstrating dynamic DOM manipulation and a fast, intuitive user interface.

Atmosphere & Aesthetic
This section features a blurred vintage train car background, setting the tone for the emotional, place-based storytelling found in Eagle 2230. The generator matches the novel’s tone: nostalgic, quiet, and cinematic.

🔧 2. Project Breakdown
📌 The Concept: "Stranger on a Train"

This interactive generator simulates the feeling of crossing paths with strangers on a long train ride — each with a story, a secret, a place they left, and a reason they’re going. It's designed to feel like browsing anonymous lives… or picking one for yourself.

This project demonstrates my ability to create thematically rich web applications that serve specific storytelling needs.

🛠️ Technical Stack

Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Logic: Randomized selection algorithm using Math.random() and Math.floor() to draw from nested arrays

Design: Custom CSS, skeuomorphic "vintage train ticket" style using layered shadows and muted color palette

✨ Key Features

Dynamic DOM Manipulation
Content updates seamlessly on each interaction, with no page refresh. Each new “ticket” populates name, occupation, origin, destination, secret, luggage, companion, and emotion.

Mobile-Responsive UI
The generator is fully responsive with intuitive UX and accessible navigation — optimized for both desktop and mobile.

Thematic Cohesion
Every design choice supports the tone of the novel: the fonts, textures, and pacing of animations feel like part of a train journey — slow, intentional, and intimate.

🧠 3. Technical Creative Narrative
Why I Built This

I built this engine to gamify the reading experience for my upcoming novel.
It began as a creative tool for readers to "draw a stranger" — to see who might be sitting across from them in the world of Eagle 2230. But it also became a demonstration of how narrative design and front-end development can work together to deepen immersion.

With a B.S. in Computer Science and a background in fiction writing, I use AI-assisted tools and rapid prototyping to explore new intersections between literature and technology.
