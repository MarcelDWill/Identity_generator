1. The Visual Presentation
    Hero Image/GIF: Use a high-quality screen recording of the generator in action. Seeing the ticket "update" instantly demonstrates your skill in creating responsive interfaces.
    The "Vibe": Since this is for your "Domain Fiction" novel, use a background for this section that feels atmospheric—perhaps a blurred image of a vintage train car.

2. The Project Breakdown
Use clear headings to satisfy both recruiters (who look for keywords) and clients (who look for results).
    The Concept: Briefly explain the "Stranger on a Train" premise. This shows you can build modern web applications that solve specific creative problems.
Technical Stack:
    Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
    Logic: Randomized selection algorithm using Math.random() and Math.floor().
    Design: Custom CSS for a skeuomorphic "vintage ticket" aesthetic.
Key Features:
    Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Explaining how the UI updates without a page refresh.
    Mobile-Friendly Design: Mention that you designed mobile-friendly and accessible UI components for the ticket.

3. The "Technical Creative" Narrative
Add a "Why I Built This" section. This is where you mention your B.S. in Computer Science and your novel.

    "I built this engine to gamify the reading experience for my upcoming novel. It demonstrates how I use AI-assisted development to rapidly prototype interactive storytelling tools."
